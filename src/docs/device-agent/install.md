# Installing Device Agent

## Prerequisites

 - NodeJS v14 or later

Note that NodeJS v14 is no longer maintained by the Node project. It is not recommended
for new installations.
 
## Supported Operating Systems

The Device Agent can be installed on most Linux distributions, Windows, and MacOS.

## Installing the Device Agent

The Device Agent is published to the public npm repository as [@flowforge/flowforge-device-agent](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flowforge/flowforge-device-agent).

It can be installed as a global npm module. This will ensure the agent
command is on the path:

### Linux/MacOS

```bash
sudo npm install -g @flowforge/flowforge-device-agent
```

### Windows

```bash
npm install -g @flowforge/flowforge-device-agent
```

### Docker

Or you can chose to run the Docker container. When you do, you'll need to mount
the `device.yml` obtained when [Registering the device](./register.md):

```bash
docker run --mount type=bind,src=/path/to/device.yml,target=/opt/flowforge-device/device.yml -p 1880:1880 flowforge/device-agent:latest
```

Or you can chose to run the Docker-Compose via a docker-compose.yml file. When you do, you'll need to mount
the `device.yml` as in Docker obtained when [Registering the device](./register.md):

```yaml
version: '3.9'

services:
  device:
    image: flowforge/device-agent:latest
    ports:
      - "1880:1880"
    volumes:
      - /path/to/device.yml:/opt/flowforge-device/device.yml
```

## Configuration

The agent configuration is provided by a `device.yml` file within its working
directory.

### Working directory

By default the agent uses `/opt/flowforge-device` or `c:\opt\flowforge-device` as
its working directory. This can be overridden with the `-d/--dir` option.

The directory must exist and be accessible to the user that will be
running the agent.

#### Linux/MacOS

```bash
sudo mkdir /opt/flowforge-device
sudo chown -R $USER /opt/flowforge-device
```

#### Windows (run elevated)

```bash
mkdir c:\opt\flowforge-device
```

### Listen Port

By default Node-RED will listen to port `1880`. The device agent has a flag to
change this behaviour and listen on another port of choosing: `-p/--port`. This can
be useful for custom firewall rules, or when running multiple device agents on
the same machine.

```bash
flowforge-device-agent --port=1881
```
